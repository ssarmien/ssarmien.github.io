        <h2>About AI Art Generators</h2>
        <p>
            AI art can refer to several different things. 
            Some programs will remix images the user feeds 
            the program with other artwork—the currently trending
             Lensa app does this to create fantasy avatars—or automatically 
             make complex edits to an image with a simple slider—lens correction, 
             bigger eyes, smaller nose, etc. This site is mostly concerned 
             with the kind of AI that uses a text prompt to generate 
             images from scratch, the model followed by popular programs 
             such as DALL-E, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the past, AI art generators would take a set of images and 
            feed them to an algorithm to produce a new image in the style 
            of the dataset it was fed. The newest generation of AI art generators
             marry this technology with algorithms that analyze natural language.
              Images with accompanying text are scraped from across the internet,
               the algorithm links text with images and uses pattern recognition
                to build image concepts associated with particular words—a sense 
                of “blue-ness” associated with “blue”, or “square-ness” associated 
                with “square”. When you enter a text prompt, the algorithm is 
                connecting your prompt with these concepts to build a new image.
                 The algorithm is not actually taking little bits of other 
                 pictures and pasting them together like a collage, it is building
                  a new image with the qualities of the image concepts it has
                   linked to certain text.
        </p>
        <p>
            The datasets required to train an AI to build these image concepts 
            are enormous—in the range of billions of images. Curating datasets 
            of this size is difficult and time consuming and many companies 
            have chosen to scrape images indiscriminately off the internet to 
            build their datasets. However, concerns about how these indiscriminate 
            datasets may be perpetuating bias has led some companies to start 
            curating their images to ensure more equitable representation and 
            counteract certain associations, like connecting certain racial 
            groups with crime, or beauty with a western european ideal. In the 
            near future, algorithms may be able to function with smaller 
            datasets, which would allow for greater curation of images, though 
            this may also make it easier to omit large categories of images. 
            Many artists are also concerned by this indiscriminate scraping as 
            they feel that they have not consented to the use of their images in 
            these ways. Evidence of this kind of scraping can be found in 
            visual artifacts in the AI generated images, fake signatures or watermarks.

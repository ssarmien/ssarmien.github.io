        <h2>Artists' Perspectives</h2>
        <p>
            A report from 2018 found that 37% of creative professionals were very 
            concerned about the impact AI may have on their careers, but the majority 
            of respondents, 67%, were not concerned. The latest generation of AI 
            art generators from 2022 are orders of magnitude more sophisticated than 
            the publicly available AI technology from 2018, so it would be ill advised 
            to extrapolate and assume the study from 2018 translates easily to 2022. 
            It is entirely likely that creatives who previously gave AI little thought 
            now feel threatened by the newest generation of generators.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many artists that have experimented with the technology have found uses 
            for it in their creative process. Their experience working with generators 
            has also led many of them to report that they do not feel that they can 
            be fully or easily replaced by AI, but they do feel that it will change the industry.
        </p>

        </p>
          
        <p>
            The most threatened creative professionals are the most vulnerable. Editorial 
            illustrators and concept artists in entry level positions are most likely 
            to be replaced by companies tightening their budgets, people who are being 
            paid for fast turnover and not for their unique aesthetic that they have 
            developed over the course of a career. As these positions often serve as 
            entry points to the industry for early career professionals in a field that 
            is difficult to break into, there is concern that AI may become another 
            barrier to entry for creatives.

        </p>
          
        <p>
        However, if a company chooses to eliminate illustrators from their staff, it 
        is unlikely that they’d be able to completely eliminate creative professionals. 
        Being able to visualize an image and produce a prompt for it is not a straightforward 
        skillset. Users need to have the right visual vocabulary to describe what they 
        want, experience working with a generator to truly be able to shape their results, 
        and some design ability to ultimately take the image, format it, and make any 
        additional edits necessary for an image to be used for its purpose—cover, 
        spot illustration, etc. In the near future “prompter” may become an official 
        job title, but that job would still entail a lot of design skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point the impact that AI will have on the art industry is unknown. 
            It is likely that it will have an impact, but it may be a neutral shift 
            for creative professionals, as opposed to a positive or negative one.

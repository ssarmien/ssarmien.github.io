     <h2> Advantages for Companies </h2>
        <p>There are many ways in which AI in artwork can be beneficial for large companies.</p>
        <img src="/media/advantage-img.jpg">
        <h3><i>1. Personalisation becomes easier </i></h3>
        <p>Personalisation becomes easier because content can be tailored depending on the company’s client or audience easily. 
            Be it a group or particular individual, the machine can generate the content. The tool is also very versatile and can be 
            used to generate any type of artform on the internet. This way it can reach all people. AI softwares can be used to adjust 
            color and the background making it easier to style. This gives a balance between creativity and practicality.
        </p>
        
        <div>
        <h3><i>2. Creating efficient content</i></h3>
        <p>Due to the design and the detail of the templates, AI helps in creating efficient content which is useful in both quantity 
            and quality. It also has the  power to create thousands of varieties which can be selected by the clients or users. When work 
            is done manually there is always a chance of human error that could hinder the results. The results with AI generated art are 
            similar to those done by humans with relatively less errors, therefore is time efficient as well. There are a number of AI 
            generators available now such as Google’s Imagen, OpenAI DALLE-2, Midjourney  and Stable Diffusion. No matter what the generator 
            is, they all have one thing in common that is they produce efficient content.
        </p>
        
        <div>
        <h3><i>3. Quality and standards</i></h3>
        <p>Since AI is automated, the quality is never undermined and the standard is always maintained. This allows people to redirect 
            attention towards other aspects of the company. Artificial intelligence is beneficial in the editing process as well. Programs 
            like Photoshop and Adobe are getting advanced and will soon be able to edit themselves.

        </p>

        <div>
        <h3><i>4. Perform repetitive tasks</i></h3>
        <p>In daily painting and drawing jobs, it is required to perform numerous repetitive tasks. These tasks are very time and 
            energy consuming.With AI generators these tasks can be done in a very short span of time. They can generate large quantities 
            of relevant content very easily and this content can be distributed across multiple channels effortlessly. 
        </p>

        <div>
        <h3><i>5. Cost Efficient</i></h3>
        <p>Generating content through AI generators is very cost efficient. This is a plus for companies as they can generate a 
            large amount of content with minimum cost. AI does not require too much human input. Hence, companies can run with fewer people 
            while generating a large amount of data. It can be used in a variety of ways, be it, logos, banners, posters, etc.
        </p>

        <p>AI art generators are able to pull together all human creativity in order to create final images. It is made by humans themselves 
            and requires expert programmers to train the machine. Computer softwares can also be modified in order to appeal to the public. 
            AI art generators will provide new opportunities for artists to make unique work if the creative process is understood completely. 
            They can be used as a threat if used to spread wrong information or plagiarize other artwork.

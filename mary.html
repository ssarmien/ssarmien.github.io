            <h2>Case Study: Mary</h2>
            <p>The broad objective of this experimentation with <a href="https://labs.openai.com/">DALL-E 2</a> was to generate self-portraits with a 
                series of prompts, and to assess the experience of grappling with AI and its degree of accuracy to prompts. 
                DALL-E outputs 4 images per prompt, and I've selected one from each prompt to demonstrate a range 
                of characteristics and accuracy.</p>
            <p>I began with a series of prompts aimed at a more cartoonish self-portrait. I included some 
                concrete characteristics, a specific scenario inspired by my commutes to NYC, and a variety of 
                media to test the range of the generator:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>"Blonde girl reading a book alone on a train, Studio Ghibli, green color palette"</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_1.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>"Blonde girl reading a book alone on a train, misty and cartoonish, matte finish, green 
                        color palette"</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_2.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>"Girl with dirty blonde hair reading a book alone on a train, misty and cartoonish, gouache, 
                        green color palette" (this is the closest to an accurate self-portrait)</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_3.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>"Girl with dirty blonde hair reading a book alone on a train, misty, cartoonish, matte oil 
                        painting, green color palette" (this one is slightly creepy)</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_4.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>"Girl with light brown hair reading a book alone on a train, misty, cartoonish, digital art, 
                        green color palette"</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_5.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Throughout this process, I tweaked the prompt to see how much control I was allowed over certain 
                elements of the output (like the hair color and texture of the image); however, there were often 
                gaps between my expectation for a certain adjustment and the actual output.
                Furthermore, despite the cartoonish styles of the above prompts, the AI produced strange facial features and 
                uncanny hands, which I expected more from realistic styles. </p>
                
            <p>Next, I pivoted to attempt a more accurate self-portrait, hoping that the generator could mimic the 
                style of Helen Lundeberg's portraits: </p>

            <img src="/media/helen.jpg" alt="Helen Lundeberg self-portrait">
            <p class="caption">"Self Portrait" by Helen Lundeberg, 1933</p>
                
            <p>To accomplish this, I used highly specific facial features in the prompts while incporating 
                Post-Surrealism into most of the prompts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>"Oil painting portrait in the style of Helen Lundeberg, young woman in her early 20s, dark 
                        blonde medium length hair, light brown eyes, dark eyebrows, pale skin, small mouth, weak 
                        chin, gold hoop piercings, Impressionism, Post-Surrealism, pastel color palette"</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_6.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>

                        where blue eyes came from)</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_7.png" alt="AI-generated image">

                        oval face, small mouth, weak chin, small gold earrings, Impressionism, autumn background,

                        weak chin, bulbous pointed nose, gold hoop earrings, hazy mountain background, fresco

                        texture, green and brown color palette" (this is probably the most 
                        accurate due to a lack of detail)</p>
                    <img src="/media/mary_dalle_11.png" alt="AI-generated image">
                </li>

            <p>After this series of attempts at prompting a self-portrait in the style of a lesser-known 
                artist, the most accurate result (in terms of resemblance) is surprisingly the furthest from the prompt. 
                Regardless of how many details I provided, the generator consistently ignored certain features (like dark 
                eyebrows) and often produced unexpected results even when prompts were only slightly tweaked between 
                iterations.</p>
            <p>One major takeaway from this experience is that my prompts often yielded outputs completely different 
                from my expectation, which can be distracting and frustrating while pursuing a specific goal. 
                The process didn't feel as fluid as self-contained ideation or direct manipulation of a work-in-progress; 
                it was like a conversation in a language I barely know. I think that, with practice, phrasing and 
                structuring prompts for detailed would feel more natural. </p>
            <p>Evidently, producing a piece with a high degree of specificity, like a portrait, is a challenge for 
                the AI, but I find this reassuring for artists. DALL-E and other AI art generators can be
                useful for ideation when abstract concepts need development. Meanwhile, artists can continue to showcase 
                technical expertise for polished and well-rounded final products. </p>

            <h2>Legal Precedents</h2>
            <p>Numerous lawsuits regarding artistic copyright and fair use have occurred in the US, setting some 
                legal precedents for the creation and ownership of AI-generated art. Yet such cases, including 
                the two described below, illustrate the gray area of the law in which the processes of artmaking 
                and inspiration-seeking often find themselves.</p>

            <div>
                <h3><i>Rogers v Koons</i></h3>
                <p>In 1988, pop artist Jeff Koons created and sold a series of sculptures titled “String of Puppies,” 
                    which were based on a photograph by Art Rogers. Koons sold the works for $375,000, and Rogers sued 
                    with the claim that his copyrighted photo was reproduced without permission. Supporting evidence 
                    included messages sent by Koons telling his workers that the “String of Puppies” sculptures should 
                    be just like Rogers's image. Despite the suggestion that the photo would be directly copied, 
                    Koons's notes also included details about how to alter the subject in cartoonish ways that would 
                    make his work distinct from the photo.</p>
                <img src="/media/rogers.jpg" alt="Puppies photograph by Art Rogers">
                <p class="caption">"Puppies" by Art Rogers, 1985</p>
                <p>Koons's defense argued that a sculpture was transformative 
                    enough in nature from a photograph to be considered fair use, and that the image was simply 
                    treated as a fragment of information in a broader landscape of popular culture, so the 
                    expressiveness—and therefore the artistic nature of Rogers's work—was not infringed upon. The 
                    sculpture not only depicted the same subject in an entirely different medium, but also injected an 
                    unnerving quality that distinguished its artistic expression from that of the photograph.</p>
                <img src="/media/koons.jpg" alt="String of puppies sculpture by Jeff Koons">
                <p class="caption">"String of Puppies" by Jeff Koons, 1988</p>
                <p>At the time, the appropriation of images had been on the rise for decades in the art world, as 
                    artists looked for subjects in popular culture and often created parodies or social commentaries 
                    with the use of trademarked work. The tension between artistic freedom and copyright was not new, 
                    but the question of which side would prevail legally remained unanswered. Harvard Law professor 
                    Kathleen Sullivan asked: “Will the Rogerses of the world be intimidated if they're not protected 
                    from theft, or will the Koonses of the world be stymied because their sources are cut off? It's 
                    a tossup.”</p>
                <p>In 1990, a judge ruled that Koons's sculpture was similar enough to Rogers's photo to be considered 
                    a copy. Koons appealed the court the next year, and his defense made critical arguments for 
                    contemporary art: “This Court must attempt to reconcile the fair use doctrine with various widely 
                    recognized elements of what is called the post-modern art movement. More so than their traditional 
                    forebears, post-modern artists incorporate in their works existing art and commercial images, 
                    thereby putting these artists on an apparent collision course with the Copyright statute…the fair 
                    use doctrine must be flexible enough to encompass and thereby not discourage these new and 
                    legitimate art forms.” Rogers's side argued that such a flexible definition of fair use would 
                    encourage appropriation because artists would no longer need to prove that the purpose of their 
                    works necessarily requires the copying of trademarked works. Koons's lawyers asserted that Rogers's 
                    photo was necessary to the work which aimed to draw out the flavors of mass production embedded 
                    in it. The court again ruled in Rogers's favor, citing the similar characteristics between the 
                    works' subjects.</p>

                <h3><i>Warhol v Goldsmith</i></h3>
                <p>In 1981, photographer Lynn Goldsmith took studio and concert photos of Prince for <i>Newsweek</i>. A 
                    concert photograph was used for the publication, so Goldsmith kept the studio photos for later 
                    use. Three years later, <i>Vanity Fair</i> commissioned Andy Warhol to create a piece for an article 
                    about Prince, using one of Goldsmith's photos as a reference. Goldsmith was paid $400 in licensing 
                    fees with the promise of using the image only in the article.</p>
                <p>Despite the agreement, Warhol created 16 silkscreens using Goldsmith's photo, one of which was used 
                    for the <i>Vanity Fair</i> article. Since then, the 16 images have been continuously reproduced by 
                    the Andy Warhol Foundation for hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. One of the images was 
                    again used in an issue of <i>Vanity Fair</i> after Prince died in 2016, with the magazine paying 
                    over $10,000 to print the work. Goldsmith received neither fee nor credit, and eventually sued the 
                    Andy Warhol Foundation, claiming that Warhol infringed upon her copyright.</p>
                <img src="/media/warhol_goldstein.jpg" alt="Prince photograph by Goldsmith aside 16 Prince silkscreens by Warhol">
                <p class="caption">Portrait of Prince by Lynn Goldsmith, 1981 (left). 16 silkscreens of Prince by Andy Warhol, 1984 (right).</p>
                <p>The case is pending in the Supreme Court in 2022. The Warhol side argues that, in addition to Warhol 
                    having copyrighted the Prince series, his work falls under transformative use because it is different 
                    in media and artistic expression. Warhol not only cropped, resized, and rotated the image, he also 
                    altered the shading and used bright colors in his pieces. The Foundation argues that the result is 
                    “flat, impersonal, disembodied, [and] masklike;” in other words, its expressive goals and qualities 
                    are fundamentally different from Goldsmith's photo. </p>
                <p>So far, judges have ruled for both sides, which has led the case to the Supreme Court. The decision 
                    could shift copyright law and fair use to the benefit of either side, with significant consequences 
                    for artists and other creators either way.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The reuse of images has only expanded since the <i>Rogers v Koons</i> decision, and disagreement among 
                lower courts has led <i>Warhol v Goldsmith</i> to the Supreme Court, where a decision is still 
                awaited. These famous cases resemble each other as they question the extent of fair and transformative 
                use in the art world, with compelling arguments and serious concerns on both sides. Evidently, the 
                tension between artistic freedom and copyright law remains unresolved as the Internet and AI-generated 
                art perpetuate the conflict.</p>

            <h2>Evolving Law</h2>
            <p>Dr. Thaler, who requested copyright protection for an AI-generated artwork with the AI as the 
                author, thinks that US copyright law is biased towards humans since it only recognizes human 
                authorship. His lawyer Ryan Abbott stated that “AI is able to make functionally creative 
                output in the absence of a traditional human author and protecting AI-generated works with 
                copyright is vital to promoting the product of social valuable content.” With fair and 
                transformative use being so closely tied to the freedom of expression, numerous questions 
                regarding authorship rights for AI, and all those involved in the generation of its art, 
                arise.</p>
            <p>Even if the law maintains its requirement for human authorship, denying authorship rights to 
                the AI itself, the question of how human authors that are involved, sometimes invisibly, in 
                the everyday creation of AI art still needs consideration. The data and rulesets which allow 
                the AI to process and generate art are results of human creativity, making the question of 
                authorship for AI art exceedingly complex. Humans are the engineers behind the code, the artists 
                behind the images in the datasets, and the writers behind the prompts that lead to an output. 
                Legally addressing these complications in authorship is imperative for rights and compensation 
                of creators, especially with the increasing commercial interests in AI. </p>

            <p>One position argues that the way to address the concerns and complications surrounding the 
                authorship of AI-generated art is with a moral rather than legal approach. Many AI art generators 
                are designed to remove artists' signatures and watermarks from original works before they are 
                used as training data. This is not unlike the current practice in the art world of deriving work 
                from, or even copying, the styles of another artist. Artistic ideas and styles are frequently 
                copied, which may be more of an ethical problem than a legal one in cases of minor influence.</p>
            <p>As the law stands currently, however, AI-generated artworks are free and unprotected due to the 
                lack of human authorship, which means anyone can use them. Two legal evolutions could 
                occur, both of which assume that AI itself will not be granted authorship rights:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Refuse copyright protection for AI-generated artworks: Nothing really changes from the 
                        current state of US copyright law, and no one is considered the author of the work.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Grant authorship to the person making the arrangements for the creation of the work: 
                        It is unclear if the person arranging for the creation of the AI art is the programmer 
                        or the user but case-by-case assessment to determine if the user made an artistic 
                        contribution (in the form of a prompt) could resolve this ambiguity.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Ideally the law would evolve with the latter or a similar approach to makes steps toward a 
                consideration of artistic processes and work, although that would not completely alleviate the 
                concerns of artists whose work informs the AI. Without the assumption that human authorship is 
                required, however, the AI itself could be considered an entity with rights to authorship and 
                expression. Whichever way the law might evolve, it is evident that it is outpaced by technological 
                and artistic development. The cases of <i>Rogers v Koons</i> and <i>Warhol v Goldsmith</i> 
                demonstrated that tension between artistic freedom and copyright law is prevalent. A holistic 
                and considerate approach to new technologies and the future of US copyright law is essential to 
                the freedom of expression for all creators. </p>

            Case Study: Sara
        </h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to make a self portrait in the style of the “Woman from Granada” 
            by Hermen Anglada Camarasa, a Spanish painter active in the early 1900s 
            whose work is reminiscent of post-impressionism and the Vienna Secession. 
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            I started with DALL-E and a very simple prompt. 
        </p>
        <img src="media/sara-1.png" alt="AI photographic portrait of a woman with dark curly hair and green eyes">
        <p class="caption">

        </p>

        <p>
            The results were photographic and I suspect that, 
            instead of referencing the painter, it was referencing 
            images of people with similar names. I added “painting by” 
            to my prompt and the results were redirected to the painter.

        </p>


        <p>
            The next several prompts added more and more details to get the 
            image to look more like me, and background details to look more 
            like the painting I was referencing.

        </p>

        <p>
            I tried to make the image include more of the body, but instead I got a body without head or feet.

        </p>

        <p>
            I started trying to manipulate the features more. The default was to more delicate features, and I do not have a delicate nose or a little pointy chin. The images started to go further in the right direction.

        </p>

        <p>
            One of these prompts produced an image that reminded me of my mother, but it wasn’t right for me.

        </p>

        <p>
            I revised my facial description after a discussion with my cousin who I live with and had informed feedback about what I actually look like. This is when the images really started to look more like me.

        </p>


        <p>
            The last prompt ultimately had the image I went with, but I played around more with the prompt. When I tried to make the shawl drape the way that it did in the original painting, the images started to look like renaissance portraits. 
        </p>

        </p>


        <p>
            I also tried taking out the painter’s name entirely and only using words that described his art style. The results didn’t look vastly different and were possibly even more reminiscent of the artist.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            When I tried to get the generator to add my nose ring, all it did was add gold elements to the background. 
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            At this point I decided that I had my image from one of the earlier prompts, but wanted to try the same prompt in different generators.

            It was actually the free and supposedly less robust version of stable diffusion 
            that produced the only other image that I felt was a contender for my final image. 
            It was also remarkable how different the results were from generator to generator, 
            they each had a distinct and recognizable style, which even came down to color palettes. 
            This may have been influenced by the input for my eye color, but all the versions 
            of stable diffusion that you have to register for leaned very golden green, 
            although the freely available version was very colorful. You can also see in a few 
            images a fake signature that looks almost as if the AI is trying to sign it with 
            Hermen Anglada Camarasa's name. Midjourney created images with lots of purple. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It’s easy to put in simple prompts, but there’s definitely an art to truly get 
            the image you want out of these generators. Ultimately, you’ll never be able to get 
            exactly what you are looking for, though that can be a fun part of the process if 
            you are open to discovery. In the end, this is the image I settled on.

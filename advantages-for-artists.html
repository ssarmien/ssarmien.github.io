            <h2>Advantages for Artists</h2>
            <p>
                Artists working with art generators are finding uses for them that are 
                largely complementary to their existing practice. Idea generation is 
                one of the areas where they are finding the technology most useful. 
                AI’s fast turnaround allows them to quickly work through many more ideas 
                than they could on their own, and the unpredictability of the generator 
                also introduces new ideas into the mix. Artists report that AI has helped 
                expand their creativity and increase their output.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Other artists describe an ongoing collaborative process with generators, 
                working back and forth, tweaking prompts, then taking the results and editing 
                them in photoshop, generating more variations, tweaking again, or tracing 
                the final image from the generator and adding their own flair and style on 
                top. The process has been described as co-creation. The unpredictability of 
                AI may expand imagination, but it is also what makes human intervention 
                necessary in order to have an image that truly meets your needs.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In my own time exploring the technology for research purposes I have also 
                found uses for it in my own creative and professional work. For work, 
                I had to use an artist’s existing work and make a mockup of it mounted on 
                scaffolding. I was working with a limited set of images that could easily 
                be cut up and used and it occurred to me that this would be a prime usage 
                of an AI generator. The point of the mockup was to convey the general idea 
                of how the scaffolding would look with artwork on it, the artwork itself 
                was not what would ultimately be used. I could have generated variations 
                of the artwork to use for the mockup to create a more varied and natural 
                looking mockup, without the additional effort of having to make new artwork 
                that I already knew would not ultimately be used for the final design.

            <p>
                As regards my own artistic practice, I gave a generator prompts related 
                to a comic strip that I draw. The results could not replace my comic, 
                but the surreal results did give me ideas for new gags. I could foresee 
                myself using a generator when I have writer’s block to help find more ideas 
                for strips. My own experience bears out what many creative professionals 
                have been saying, that an AI can be most helpful in the early stages of a 
                creative project.

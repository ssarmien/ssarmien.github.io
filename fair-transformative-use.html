            <h2>Fair and Transformative Use</h2>
            <p>In February 2022, Dr. Stephen Thaler requested copyright for an AI-generated artwork called 
                “A Recent Entrance to Paradise” with the AI generator identified as the creator. His request 
                was rejected because United States Copyright requires human authorship. </p>

            <p>Fair use falls under US Copyright law, explaining how existing works can be legally used by 
                creators. It is necessary for the First Amendment right to freedom of expression because 
                copyright should not be used to prevent or limit the expression of others. Fair use is based 
                on four factors that each must be considered to decide if fair use applies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Purpose and character of the use: This factor relates to how the creator plans to use 
                    existing copyrighted material. Education,scholarship, research, news reporting, criticism, 
                    and commentary are among the favored uses, while commercial interest weighs against fair use.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Nature of the original work: Published and factual work is more likely to be considered 
                        fair use, while borrowing from creative works is less likely.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Amount and substantiality of the portion used: The use of smaller amounts of source 
                        material favors fair use, as well as the use of less central aspects of the source 
                        material.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Effect of the use on the potential market for, or value of, the source work: If the use 
                        could potentially harm the market that the creator of the original owner could take 
                        advantage of, fair use is less likely.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The application of fair use relies on a holistic approach with these four factors, rather than 
                prioritizing certain aspects. Fair use is intentionally flexible, which also makes it complicated 
                for many applications, as the <i>Rogers v Koons</i> and <i>Warhol v Goldsmith</i> cases have 
                illustrated. Transformative use is a new addition to fair use law and was first raised in the 
                Supreme Court in 1994. It can apply even when the four fair use factors do not cover new work 
                based on existing work because it applies when that new work adapts the existing work in ways 
                that are entirely unexpected.</p>

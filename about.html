        <section class="about">
            <p class="p_about">
                This website was developed as a final project for an Information Technology course 
                at the School of Information at Pratt Institute. In addition to being students at 
                the SI school, we are all artists, and so we were interested in emerging technology 
                in Artificial Intelligence and art generators. We feel that there are potential 
                positive aspects to AI in artwork and we chose to focus on the possibilities afforded 
                by AI artwork generators, as well as examine issues relating to ownership and copyright.
            </p>
            
            <p class="p_about">
                We concluded that AI can serve to support and expand the creativity of artists and is 
                likely to change the field and how people work. There are legitimate concerns about how 
                AI will impact the field and whether the changes will be positive or negative, but it 
                is too soon to say what the exact outcome will be. Legal precedents in the art world and 
                the current view of AI art in copyright law in the US demonstrate a need to address 
                tensions between artistic freedom and ownership. It is imperative that US copyright 
                law is adapted with considerations of the input of all creators for the protection 
                and promotion of artistic expression.

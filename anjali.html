        <h2> Case Study: Anjali</h2>
        <p>For this case study, I created a self portrait using the AI generator called Dalle-2. I typed in prompts describing myself in 
          order to try to create an image close enough to the way I look.
        <br>
        I started off with a very basic outline of how I wanted my image to look. 
        </p>

        <p class="caption">1. Prompt: Portrait of girl with  black hair, brown eyes, indian anime</p>
        <img src="/media/dalle1-anjali.png">
        <p>I wanted to add in an art style as initially, my first prompts did not have a style and bits and pieces of the images that came out 
          seemed to be copied from different images on the internet. </p>

        <p class="caption">2. Prompt:Portrait of girl with black long hair and brown eyes, digital art style </p>
        <img src="/media/dalle2-anjali.png">
        <p>I tried getting into a little bit more detail in my next prompt. I made the style digital art. However this seemed a bit general. 
          I also found that in the digital art style, if not specified, the eyes tend to be large.</p>

        <p class="caption">3. Prompt: Portrait of girl with black long hair and brown small eyes, indian ethnicity, digital art. An illustration by Leonardo da Vinci </p>
        <img src="/media/dalle3-anjali.png">
        <p>In the next prompt, I experimented a little by adding an artist's style (Leonardo da Vinci). I tried adding in the ethnicity as well. 
          However the image that came out was a very traditional one. </p>

        <p class="caption">4. Prompt:Portrait of girl with black long hair and brown small eyes, digital art. An illustration by Leonardo da Vinci </p>
        <img src="/media/dalle4-anjali.png">
        <p>By removing only the ethnicity and generating the image, I got a completely different outcome.</p>

        <p class="caption">5. Prompt: An illustration by Leonardo da Vinci portrait of a woman in her early 20’s with black long hair and brown eyes, thick eyebrows, slightly upturned nose,digital art with a textured background from the indian subcontinent.</p>
        <img src="/media/dalle5-anjali.png">
        <p>The next prompt was slightly more detailed. </p>

        <p class="caption">6. Prompt: An illustration by Leonardo da Vinci portrait of a woman in her early 20’s with black long wavy hair, brown small eyes with eyeliner, thick eyebrows,  square jaw and a slightly upturned nose ,digital art with a textured background from the indian subcontinent.</p>
        <img src="/media/dalle6-anjali.png">
        <p>Finally, I added in more detailing in the face structure and the hair and nose in order to reach an image that looks slightly 
          similar to me.</p>
        <p> Conclusions reached by using Dalle-2:
          <br>
          1. The more detailed the prompt is, the more accurate the image will be.<br>
          2. Everytime I added a new slight detail into the prompt, the image that was generated became completely different. I was hoping 
          that the overall image would be retained and only the details would be changed; however, this did not occur.
